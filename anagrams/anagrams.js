/*
10. Anagrams
An anagram is any word or phrase that uses the letters of a given ("subject") word or phrase in another, rearranged order. Write a function that creates an anagram list, listing all the rearrangements of a given word. For example, if the user types "east", the program should list all 24 permutations, including "eats", "etas", "teas", and non-words like "tsae".

Hint: For your algorithm, you might want to think about a prefix and use that to create the new words.
For example, given "east", use "e" as a prefix and place it in front of all 6 permutations of
"ast" â€” "ast", "ats", "sat", "sta", "tas", and "tsa". This will give you the words "east", "eats", "esat", "esta", "etas", and "etsa".
Continue this way until you find all the anagrams for "east".
Then you can use "a" as a prefix and permute the remaining words "est".
For "east", there should be 24 words

so... it would do something like ...
take 1st letter and ice it from rest like 
[e,ast]
then re-arange the rest based on the wether that pattern was hit or not,
like 
[e,ats]
[e,tsa]
[e,tas]
[e,sat]
[e,sta]
